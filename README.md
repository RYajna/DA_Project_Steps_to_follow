This serves as a checklist to the important steps in creating a Data Analytics Project

Here's a complete summary of the steps covered in the "Learning Excel datasets" video, including the quick and dirty analytics steps:

 -   Check Column Headings: Ensure all column headings are meaningful and correctly named.
  -  Verify Right Alignment: Check if numbers are right-aligned by default, indicating they are recognized as numbers by Excel.
  -  Count Columns: Use Shift + Ctrl + Right Arrow to count the number of columns.
 -   Check for Broken Data: Use Ctrl + A to select all data and ensure there are no solid blank columns or rows.
  -  Count Rows: Use Shift + Ctrl + Down Arrow to count the number of rows and records.
 -   Sum Data: Highlight the relevant column and use the auto calculate feature to get the sum.
 -   Check for Duplicates: Use Conditional Formatting to highlight duplicate values, especially in key columns like Order ID.
 -   Quick and Dirty Analytics:
      -  Summing Data: Quickly total a column to check for expected values.
       - Counting Records: Use auto calculate to count rows and columns.
       - Spotting Duplicates: Use Conditional Formatting to highlight duplicate values.

To combine different files in Excel using Power Query, follow these steps:

   Open a New Workbook: Start with a new blank workbook in Excel.
    Go to the Data Tab: Navigate to the "Data" tab and select "Get Data".
    Choose From File: Select "From File" and then "From Folder".
    Browse to Folder: Browse to the folder containing your CSV files and click "OK".
    Combine and Load: Excel will list all files in the folder. Click "Combine" and then "Combine and Load".
    Sample File: Excel will use the first file as a sample. Click "OK" to proceed.
    Load Data: The combined data from all files will be loaded into your workbook.

 You can list all column headers, note whether they are original or added later, and provide descriptions for each field
